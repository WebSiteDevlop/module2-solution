		<p>
			PIZZA. Although it is one of the world's simplest and most popular foods, pizza is oddly difficult to define. Centuries of evolution have transformed it from the patties made of mashed grains that were its earliest antecedents into a dish that, though related to those early grain cakes, is almost unrecognizable as their descendant.

			Vada pav is one of the most humble street food of Mumbai, yet it is tasty and delicious. Wada pav basically has Batata vada which is sandwiched between two slices of a pav, along with sweet chutney, green chutney and dry garlic chutney.

		<p>
			Pastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening (solid fats, including butter) that may be savoury or sweetened. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery. The word "pastries" suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries.
